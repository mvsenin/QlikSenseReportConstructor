# Qlik Sense Report Constructor
Qlik Sense Report Constructor is the automation tool allows generating the JSON
content of the Qlik and VizLib plain tables with the configured set of
the dimensions and measures which can be shown/hidden by filters with
the %FieldGroup, %DimensionLabel, and %MeasureLabel fields.

The more dimensions & measures your table retains, the harder its support is, so
it really makes sense to automate the process a little bit. :-)

Please refer to the How-To Qlik Sense Report Constructor.txt for more details
and instructions.

Cheers!
