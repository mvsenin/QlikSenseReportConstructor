0. Start from "Qlik Sense Report Constructor.xlsm" file:
	- Select "Chart type" on the "Config" tab
	- Generate content for the Dimensions & Measures tabs
		- you can build plain table in the destination app with two dimensions: $Table, $Field,
		  and download the list of the fields
		- then, use the fields for discription of the dimensions and measures
	- Once ready, run the ProcessReportConstructorData procedure (Ctrl+F11 or other way)

* Note: it's recommended to clone the "Qlik Sense Report Constructor" folder for each project/app individually

1. Adopt the "Report Constructor" script from the "tst.constructor.qvf" app to your app content
	- dimension table (_Dimensions):
		%DimensionName, %DimensionLabel
	- measure table (_Measures):
		%MeasureName, %MeasureLabel, %MeasureExpression
	- field groups table (_FieldGroups):
		%FieldGroup

2. generate and copy JSON for the following Qlik Sense objects:
	- VizLib plain table
	- Qlik Sense plain table

3. open you app and add "/options/developer" to the very end of the URLs
	- add Qlik Sense objects:
		- filter with %DimensionLabel field
		- filter with %MeasureLabel field
		- filter with %FieldGroup field
		- VizLib plain table
		- Qlik Sense plain table
	For VizLib plain table
		- call context menu Developer > Properties of 
		- paste copied properties to the corresponding text box
		- press Close
	For Qlik Sense plain table
		- call context menu Developer > Properties
		- paste copied properties to the corresponding text box
		- press Close
4. now your table should show dimensions and measures according to selections made in the filters added on the step 3

Notes:
- properties generation logic should be checked against other object types and might need changes
